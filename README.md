This nifty programming toolbox contains all of your reusable code, for the sake of time conservation. Each tool subset
holds code for correlating return types (ex: StringUtils, ArrayUtils, CollectionUtils, Int/BoolUtils, etc.). 

Feel free to copy and paste as needed; rewrite; or snuggle up with (time together is the only REAL way get to know your
beautiful code). :)
